# Machine Learning Examples with Scikit-Learn

This Jupyter Notebook provides basic examples of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn.

## Supervised Learning:

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Example: KNN_Classification.ipynb

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.

### Decision Tree
- Example: DecisionTree_Classification.ipynb

This example showcases the Decision Tree algorithm for classification.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Example: SVM_Classification.ipynb

Here, we use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification.

## Unsupervised Learning:

### K-Means Clustering
- Example: KMeans_Clustering.ipynb

In this example, we demonstrate the K-Means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning.

## How to Use the Notebooks:

1. Open the respective Jupyter Notebook file for the algorithm you want to explore.
2. Follow the code and comments to understand the algorithm and its usage.
3. Run the code cells to execute the examples.
